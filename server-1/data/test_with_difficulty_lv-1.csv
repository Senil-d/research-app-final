what is the value of n if the sum of the consecutive odd intergers e from 1 to n equals 169 ,"before you tackle this question you must first understand that the question is comprised of two key parts , 1 st is finding out how manytermsis in that sequence and 2 nd whatactual number valuethat term is . in an arithmetic progression , in this case consecutive odd integers 1 , 3 , 5 , . . . . , there are two set of rules . rule  1  arithmetic sequence   xn = a + d  n - 1  identifies what the actual  in the sequence would be . each number in the sequence has a term such as 1  is the first term  , 3  is the second term  and so on . so if i were to ask you to find out what the 10 th term is of that sequence you would use that formula to find that value . a = 1  first term  d = 2  the common difference  remember in the sequence 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 the common difference is always 2 * on a side note we use n - 1 because we do n  t have d in the first term , therefore if we were solving for the first term we would get 0 as n - 1 and 0 times d would give us 0 , leaving only the first term . this works regardless what your first term is in any sequence . but remember the question askswhat is thevalueof n if the sum of the consecutive odd integers from 1 to n equals 169  which means we first need a consecutive sequence that sums up to 169 and than find what the value of the n is , in this case it would be the last number in that sequence . in order to find that we first need to knowhow many terms  how many of the n there is  in order to be able to plug n in this formula given we know what the sum is . for that to happen we need to use rule  2 . rule  2  summing an arithmetic series   169 = n / 2  2 a +  n - 1  d  . given the question gives us what the sum is  169 in this case  we would simply use this formula to solve for n . once we solve for n  13 in this case  we can simply plug n into the first formula  rule 1  and find the value . it feels very confusing and difficult at first , but once you identify the steps all you need to do is plug and play . we have the sum  169  of a sequence , the number of terms in that sequence is  unknown  . rule  2 tells us how many numbers there are in that sequence and rule  1 gives us what that last term is .","a ) 47 , b ) 25 , c ) 37 , d ) 33 , e ) 29",b,"add(subtract(multiply(sqrt(169), const_2), multiply(const_2, 1)), 1)","multiply(n0,const_2)|sqrt(n1)|multiply(#1,const_2)|subtract(#2,#0)|add(n0,#3)|",general,"{'a': '47', 'b': '25', 'c': '37', 'd': '33', 'e': '29'}",1,5,medium

two mixtures of a and b have a and b in the ratio 3  2 and 3  4 . in what proportion should these two mixtures be mixed to get a new mixture in which the ration of a to b is 5  4 ,"i got c but with a different , yet slightly longer approach , which i constantly use for proportion problems such as this one . usually , this approach is very efficient when used with slightly difficult questions , but this problem is quite hard so i had to slightly tweak it . i will show you how i usually use the approach and later show you how to use it with this specific problem . example . 1 liter of solution a contains 45 % alcohol , while 1 liter of solution b contains 20 % alcohol . in what ratio must the two solutions be used to get a solution with 30 % alcohol solution  1 . 45 / 100 *  a /  a + b   + 20 / 100 *  b /  a + b   = 30 / 100 2 . multiply 100 to both sides to arrive at 45 a /  a + b  + 20 b /  a + b  = 30 3 . multiply  a + b  to both sides to arrive at 45 a + 20 b = 30 a + 30 b 4 . distribute to arrive at 15 a = 10 b 5 . thus the ratio is a / b = 10 / 15 = 2 / 3 now using this same approach , we tackle gopu 106  s question . it is important to first think of x in the mixture as the alcohol in the problem above  hence , a mixture of x and y in the ratio of 3  2 translates to x is 3 / 5 of the solution . applying this concept to all three equations , we write  1 . 3 / 5 *  a /  a + b   + 3 / 7 *  b /  a + b   = 5 / 9 2 . now here is the tweak that must be made to continue with this approach . you must find the common denominator for all three numbers and organize the fractions accordingly . by finding the common denominator of 5 , 79  or 315  we re - write the equations as follows 3 . 189 / 315 *  a /  a + b   + 135 / 315 *  b /  a + b   = 175 / 315 4 . multiply 315 to both sides to arrive at 189 a /  a + b  + 135 b /  a + b  = 175 5 . multiply  a + b  to both sides to arrive at 189 a + 135 b = 175 a + 175 b 6 . distribute to arrive at 14 a = 40 b 7 . thus the ratio is a / b = 40 / 14 = 20 / 7 or answer c","a ) 6 : 1 , b ) 5 : 4 , c ) 20 : 7 , d ) 10 : 9 , e ) 14 : 11",c,"divide(subtract(divide(5, add(5, 4)), divide(const_3, add(3, 4))), subtract(divide(3, 5), divide(5, add(5, 4))))","add(n3,n4)|add(n0,n3)|divide(n0,n4)|divide(n4,#0)|divide(const_3,#1)|subtract(#3,#4)|subtract(#2,#3)|divide(#5,#6)",other,"{'a': '6 : 1', 'b': '5 : 4', 'c': '20 : 7', 'd': '10 : 9', 'e': '14 : 11'}",2,8,hard
